## 👋 Hi, I'm **Bill**.

I'm a software developer with a passion for building systems that are clear, expressive, and fun to use.  
I've been programming since I was a kid — and I still love it just as much now.

### 💼 My Background

- 💻 I offer deep expertise from a rich background in software development, with a focus on *business systems* (GIS, statistics, simulation modeling, inventory databases) and, more recently, *video games* (Unity with C#).
- 🎮 Last year, I worked for a game studio, where I helped build gameplay systems until the company unfortunately folded. That experience reignited my enthusiasm for interactive design and storytelling systems.
- 🛠️ These days, I’m building small games and tools to sharpen my skills, expand my portfolio, and reconnect with the joy of making things work.
- 📚 I’m especially interested in systems design, creative coding, and games that explore narrative, strategy, or simulation.

### 🔍 What I'm Looking For

I'm actively seeking **remote work** where I can:

- Use my deep technical experience in a collaborative, thoughtful environment
- Help design, build, or maintain systems with care and clarity
- Contribute to games, tools, or interactive media that bring joy or solve real problems

My ideal role would be one where strong communication and creative problem-solving are valued alongside technical skill. I thrive in mission-driven teams—or independently—bringing a user-focused mindset to every project.
